# 1 Introduction
- We develop simple methods for creating a sample-efficient reasoning dataset (§2)
- and test-time scaling (§3); 
- Based on these we build s1-32B, which is competitive with o1-preview (§4); 
- We ablate subtleties of data (§5.1) and test-time scaling (§5.2). 
- We end with a discussion to motivate future work on simple reasoning (§6). 
- Our code, model, and data are open-source at https://github.com/simplescaling/s1.
